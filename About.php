              <p class="test7">All Client Accounts are 100% free, while Talent accounts are incredibly affordable, no matter what your budget is. We believe that every actor or model should have access to castings that they could be a fit for, without paying an arm and a leg, and take no commission from talent when you book a job! That means you keep your whole check!</p>

              <p class="test7 write"> Accounts can be created any time of day, and are usually activated within 24 hours. Once activated, you can submit on castings and use all site features immediately, and our staff will begin submitting you on, and notifying you of some of the biggest castings around.</p>
