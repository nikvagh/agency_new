                    <p align="left" style="font-weight: bold">Create the pages of your web site</p>
                    <p align="left">First let's go to the Manage Pages screen by selecting this item from the menu. </p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="help/80.gif" width="176" height="142"></p>
                    <p align="left">You'll see a number of pages have already been set up to get you started.&nbsp; You will be able to edit, add to, or delete from these pages.&nbsp; Let's start by editing the content of your Home page.&nbsp; This is the first page users will see when they come to your site.</p>
                    <p align="left">On the line in the list of pages with the label &quot;Home&quot;, click on the &quot;EDIT&quot; link:</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="help/40.gif" width="600" height="77"> </p>
                    <p align="left">You may scroll over the question marks on the Manage Pages page to discover how to use the other options.</p>
                    <p align="left">You will find yourself on a page which looks like this: </p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="help/50.gif" width="600" height="192"></p>
                    <p align="left">Using the number labels as reference:</p>
                    <p align="left">The &quot;Page name as it appears in the menu&quot; [1] is simply what appears in the navigational menu on the left of the main site:</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="help/150.gif" width="188" height="152"></p>
                    <p align="left">The Heading [2], on the other hand, is what appears at the top of the web page content, for example: </p>
                    <p align="center"> <img src="help/110.gif" width="339" height="103"></p>
                    <p align="left">The Heading can be left blank of you do not wish to have a heading on a page. </p>
                    <p align="left">You'll find editing the text on the page similar to using a standard word processor program.&nbsp; You'll be able to create <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italic</i> text [3], create text in different colors [4], alter the size of your text [5], insert images [6], or create links [7] to other pages or sites.&nbsp; Feel free to explore all the options.&nbsp; If things get too messed up, just hit the Cancel button on the bottom of the page.</p>
                    <p align="left">The &quot;Place Menu Item live on the site&quot; checkbox allows you to put the page immediately up on your site, or keep it hidden from the public for later editing.</p>
                    <p align="left">Now you know how to work with pages on your site!</p>
                    <p align="left">To create additional pages, simply click &quot;Add New Page&quot; on the menu:</p>
                    <p align="center"><img src="help/130.gif" width="180" height="73"> </p>
                    <p align="left" style="font-weight: bold">Congratulations!&nbsp; At this point you already know all you need to know to create a web site!</p>
                    <p align="left">To enhance your site, you may wish to explore some more features.&nbsp; You may select &quot;VIEW SITE&quot; from the menu at any time to view the site as visitors will see it.&nbsp; When you are <i>logged in as the administrator</i>, an &quot;ADMIN AREA&quot; link is added to the bottom of the site menu which you can use to get back to making alterations to your site.&nbsp; </p>
