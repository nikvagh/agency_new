        renewal options, unless deactivated by the subscribing User. THE AGENCY ONLINE will automatically charge the membership fee to the User's designated
        payment method and you authorize us to charge such payment method for the appropriate membership fees and amounts stated. THE AGENCY ONLINE reserves
        the right to increase membership fees or to institute new fees at any time, upon reasonable notice posted in advance on this Website. The act of paying fees does

        not result in any refund or credit of fees already paid. Membership fees are charged up-front and no refunds or credits will be given upon cancellation or
        downgrades. The downgrade of a membership will go into effect at the end of your current billing cycle.
